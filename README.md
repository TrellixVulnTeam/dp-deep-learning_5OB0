# dp-deep-learning
Class Project for CS395T (Deep Learning Seminar)

TODO : Rewrite Optimizers with Differentially Privacy

TODO : Use batch size, input size, and number of epochs to decide on best parameters to prevent overfitting.

TODO : Find networks with FC layers that overfit on tasks to test our methods.

TODO : Use https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/JMLRdropout.pdf to decide on experiments/graphs for project report.
